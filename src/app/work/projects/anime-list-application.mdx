## Overview

A Flutter-based mobile application that allows users to browse, search, and track their favorite anime series. The app fetches real-time data from external anime APIs and presents it through an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

## Key Features

- **Anime Discovery**: Browse popular, trending, and upcoming anime series
- **Advanced Search**: Filter anime by genre, season, year, and status
- **Personal Watchlist**: Save favorite anime and track watching progress
- **Detailed Information**: Comprehensive details including synopsis, episodes, ratings, and characters
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized UI for various screen sizes and orientations

## Technical Implementation

### Mobile Application
- **Framework**: Flutter with Dart programming language
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for efficient state handling
- **API Integration**: RESTful consumption of external anime APIs
- **Caching Strategy**: Local storage for offline access to previously viewed content
- **Image Loading**: Optimized image caching and loading with placeholder support

### API Integration
- **Data Fetching**: HTTP requests with error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Response Parsing**: Efficient JSON parsing and data model creation
- **Rate Limiting**: Proper handling of API rate limits and quotas
- **Error Management**: Graceful handling of network errors and empty states

### User Interface
- **Custom Widgets**: Reusable UI components for consistent design
- **Smooth Animations**: Engaging transitions and micro-interactions
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Support for multiple theme preferences
- **Responsive Layout**: Adaptive design for phones and tablets

## Architecture Design

### Data Layer
- **Repository Pattern**: Separation of data sources and business logic
- **Model Classes**: Strongly typed data models for type safety
- **Local Storage**: Hive for efficient local data persistence
- **Network Management**: Dio client for advanced HTTP features

### Presentation Layer
- **Business Logic Components**: Organized feature-based architecture
- **State Management**: Centralized state handling with Provider
- **Route Management**: Clean navigation stack with named routes
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper dependency management setup

## Performance Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**: Infinite scroll for large anime lists
- **Image Optimization**: Cached network images with compression
- **Memory Management**: Efficient widget disposal and resource cleanup
- **Build Optimization**: Constrained rebuilds for better performance

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Handling large datasets from API responses
**Solution**: Implemented pagination and lazy loading for smooth scrolling

**Challenge**: Maintaining UI responsiveness during data fetching
**Solution**: Used asynchronous programming with proper loading states

**Challenge**: Cross-platform consistency
**Solution**: Leveraged Flutter's single codebase for iOS and Android

**Challenge**: API rate limiting
**Solution**: Implemented smart caching and request queuing

## Technologies Used

- **Mobile Framework**: Flutter, Dart
- **State Management**: Provider
- **HTTP Client**: Dio, Http
- **Local Storage**: Hive, Shared Preferences
- **Development Tools**: Android Studio, Flutter SDK
- **API**: External anime REST API

## Outcome
